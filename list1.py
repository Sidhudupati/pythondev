#If we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single entity where insertion
#	order preserved and duplicates are allowed, then we should go for List.

#	Insertion order preserved.
#	Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
#	List is dynamic because based on our requirement we can increase the size and decrease the size.
#	In List the elements will be placed within square brackets and with comma seperator.
	
#	We can differentiate duplicate elements by using index and we can preserve insertion
#	order by using index. 
	
#	Hence index will play very important role.

#	Python supports both positive and negative indexes. 
#	+ve index means from left to right
#	where as negative index means right to left
